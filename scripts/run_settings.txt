# NOTES TO CONSIDER WHEN BUILDING THIS DATASET:
#   1) If running the Temporal program for multiple dates, you can either turn
#      off all or none of the dates per run.  To do this, make sure that the
#      date range given includes the FIRST date of each Temporal program run.
#   2) Entries do not need to be here for a "Yes", since the defaults in the
#      main run script are assumed to be "Yes".  However, including "Y" entries
#      will not hurt anything.
#   3) Sector-specific "Y" entries will override Sector = "all" "N" entries 
#      for the same grid, program, part, and date range.
#   4) (Added by C. Allen) If you set Temporal to Y, then this induces a bug
#      where the Temporal files are deleted after they are created. To avoid,
#      never set Temporal to Y to override an "all=N" setting (only use N settings).
#   5) (Added by C. Allen) The domain totals program ("domain") doesn't work for
#      files larger than 2 GB. Therefore, it is turned off for 12EUS1.
